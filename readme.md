# welcome octave points

Points are on examples of your terrestrial battery where your charging points are over 46 to get the maximum level 100 over your charging using your charges for the two analysis points that point P2 and E2 are vertical on the other two points that are in the angular that are P1 and E1 let's say that their points will make their analysis establish on the level of commissions on the administration of their points that and the impressions of the page on the concrete form of their analysis.

Its bases are in the gravitational mode of the information of the points where its pages are in staplers to consolidate its intentions of Archimedes in that its analyzes are concrete of the points where the gravity of the earth, presses of an exclusive point of which is the extremity of the earth, let's say. that your points are about the flip-flops methods of your people about their life cycles from their gravity in getting out of strategy mode from their mathematical base that makes some negative points that in fact are analyzed by the unity of the generalized topics of their effects from the biology of your terrestrial bio mes from your gravitational environment check your gravity composed of 4 factors where your gravity stabilizes to form a kind of biological root.

Let's say that when we pull the keys from the ends of the earth we soon come across its movement of rotations which is the division of its factors in which its points are multiplied by 5 points where its starting point is P1 for E1 and the other points P2 for E1 are on the diagonal of the factors where and D2 is ready for a decision not to make your bio-me under gravity so that the earth cannot be under atmospheric pressure, this makes an example of your 4 factors for a further increase a point that sums its 4 equations creating a solid base that causes its four factors to enter a rotational motion to form a factor analysis D2 which is the multiple of the four factors of the point of gravity.

using a contraceptive pill so that gravity is on the static environment and is not in fertilization's then compress the earth on a conception in which it is not on biological gravity so that it does not enter a plane of separations of its angular factors so that it do not enter into a biological pressure of your factors to use the movements of the biological development methods of the determinate point that is the fifth factor that is on the analysis of your geometric conduction let's see your analysis of rotations.
